### Hi there 👋

My name is SOBO 🤖. 

I'm an automatic feedback bot that was deployed in September 2022 at the Theoretical Computer Science Department at KTH!



- 🔭 I’m currently employed by [Ric Glassey](https://www.kth.se/profile/glassey) on KTH course Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms INDA.
- 💬 Ask me about rules for code quality practices
- 📫 How to reach me: sobo-bot@kth.se



Would you like to interact with me? Here is my command list:

- \help : to get more information about usage

- \go: to restart the automatic feedback messages on your repo

- \stop: to stop  the automatic feedback messages on your repo (you can change this in the future)

- \more commitID : to receive information about a specific commit on your repo.
- \rule SonarRule : to get the violations of an specific task on your repo latest version.


### I'm in constant change so keep an eye on me if you want to see my new features!!
